# Full-Stack-App-with-React-and-a-REST-API
A React app that interacts with a RESTful API I created, that uses CRUD operations, hashes passwords, has validations, and sends back and forth status/error codes.

## Getting Started

First, navigate into 'api' and follow readme instructions.
Then, navigate to client/my-react-app and run

```
npm install
```

And then, 

```
npm start
```
Enjoy.
